1.Project Overview:
The project entails the development of a file encoder employing Huffman encoding, a compression algorithm renowned for its effectiveness in reducing text size by approximately 34% compared to the original. This algorithm is classified under the greedy category, demonstrating its efficiency in making locally optimal choices during the encoding process.

2.Algorithm Characteristics:
The employed Huffman encoding algorithm operates within the greedy paradigm, systematically making optimal choices at each step to achieve compression results that significantly diminish the size of the encoded text. The algorithm's ability to efficiently select locally optimal solutions contributes to its success in reducing file sizes, making it a valuable tool in text compression applications.
